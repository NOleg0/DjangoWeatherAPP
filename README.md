# DjangoWeatherAPP
An application for the weather forecast at the current time. The user can view the weather in a particular place where he wants it. 
The application consists of one page, which contains a search bar, a tile with the current weather at the moment, 
and tiles with several previous weather forecast queries. 
As a result, the user receives information about the current temperature, pressure, wind speed, perceived temperature, cloud cover, humidity and visibility range. 
All the requested cities are recorded in the database. From there, the results of previous queries are loaded. 
The application is developed using the Django framework. I used SQLite3 as a database.
